my Kotlin-based Meal Suggestion App, built in Android Studio. This app provides meal suggestions based on the time of day using a simple and user-friendly interface. Users can select a time, tap the "Get Suggestion" button, and receive an appropriate meal recommendationâ€”like breakfast in the morning, lunch around midday, or dinner in the evening. There's also a reset button to clear the suggestion and start over. The project is integrated with GitHub for version control and uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD, ensuring that every push runs automated checks to maintain build quality.
